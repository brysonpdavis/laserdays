Description

  Amplify Occlusion offers an efficient way to simulate realistic shadowing around 
  objects, it can even account for light occlusion allowing for non-uniform shadows
  providing additional depth to scenes. It takes the best out of fast performing SSAO,
  the accurate and flexible results provided by approximate obscurance-based techniques
  and combines it into a all-in-one flexible Unity package.
